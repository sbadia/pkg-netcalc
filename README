IP network calculator
=====================
[![Travis Status][]][Travis]

netcalc is a slimmed down clone of [sipcalc][], using the output format
of [ipcalc][].  It is written in C and has very few dependencies.  Both
IPv4 and IPv6 is supported.

The original sipcalc project was started by Simon Ekstrand in 2001.  No
longer in active development, but has a lot of features and is available
on major Linux distributions and works on *BSD and Solaris.
